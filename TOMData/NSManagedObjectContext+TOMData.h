/**
 The `NSManagedObjectContext(TOMData)` category extends `NSManagedObjectContext` with a set of utility methods.
 
 ### Using the Predefined Managed Object Contexts
 
 You can utilize the `rootContext` as the base context for your app by assigning it a persistent store coordinator. Root context should primarily be used for direct interaction with persistent stores. Because it uses a private queue, every save to persistent store is done on a separate thread.
 
 For main queue interaction you can utilize the `mainContext`, which is a direct child of `rootContext` that operates on main queue. You will probably be interactiong with this context the most as it should be used for all user interface operations. Saving `mainContext` does however not automatically persist changes. To save changes to your persistent stores, be sure to use `saveWithParentContext` or `saveWithParentContexts` methods.
